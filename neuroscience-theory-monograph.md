## Chapter 8: The OMEGA Loop Model of Intelligence

### 8.1 Superfluid Intelligence

Intelligence is moving matter. Intelligence is dancing, moving, jiggling, electrostatic energy moving matter. It is a deluge of electrostatic neural activity maintaining action-perception cycles directed forward in time. Thus, one key defining feature of intelligence is directed toward superfluid homeostasis, and that is irrespective of event size, intelligence is always directed toward superfluid homeostasis, regardless of whether it is a single neuron or an ensemble of synchronously firing neurons, the goal remains the same: superfluidity. As such, intelligence is irreducible beyond the size of individual neurons.

In the case of electrophysiology [MEEG](https://twitter.com/crockpics/status/1533237169354964993?s=21&t=p6AnSQ2fjcNDSVCiNzSSKA) intelligence is reducible to optimally switching between two states: on or off. Consider the pyramidal neuron in the mammalian neocortex without whom MEEG and perhaps cognitive neuroscience would be both be unlikely scientific enterprises. Intelligence is moving matter on the scale of approximately 20 microns: that is 0.001mm, or about 0.000039inch packed into super columns 7-stories, actually 7-layers of convoluted dancing, moving, jiggling, electrostatic moving matter.

According to Mountcastle and Fuster, the cerebral cortex is an engine designed to transduce multiple macroscopic currents of action-perception cycles forward from tail to nose, through posterior sensory organs of seeing & hearing to the crown of the head, or where modern phrenology has bequeathed areas or regions controlling executive decision making.

### 8.2 The OMEGA Loop: A Thermodynamic Model

![OMEGA Loop Model](zatorre2)

*Figure 8.1: The OMEGA Loop model showing the relationship between P(B|A) as state of criticality (SOC), flowing through the cycle from p50 to p300 and back through the delta (δ) component.*

The OMEGA Loop represents a fundamental cycle in neural processing where intelligence emerges from the thermodynamic properties of the brain. As illustrated in Figure 8.1, the loop connects early perceptual processes (p50) to later cognitive processes (p300) through states of self-organized criticality (SOC), with change in entropy (ΔS) feeding back through a delta (δ) component.

According to the classic evoked dendritic current model, the current field of a single neuron or ensemble of cortical pyramidal cells, **I($\tau$)** is the integral of synaptic response time _h(t)_ and incoming pulse train **P(t')**:

$I(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^t,d\tau'h(t-t')P(t')$

I'd like to extend on the chronometric principle that given cognition takes time, then intelligence [g] is superfluid, with thermodynamic conservatory time ($\tau$) function in response to quantum vibratory input-output (IO) on different real world spacetime scales; _cf_ avian vs. homosapien saccadic activity.

**_Cognition takes time because it requires energy in a universe where conservation is key._**

### 8.3 Bayesian Framework and Sexual Dimorphism

![Extended OMEGA Loop](zatorre3)

*Figure 8.2: The extended OMEGA Loop model illustrating the relationships between Bayesian inference, sexual dimorphism, and fluid intelligence through states of self-organized criticality.*

In the extended OMEGA Loop model (Figure 8.2), we see that fluid intelligence [g]<sup>t</sup> emerges from a cycle that begins with Bayesian inference P(A|B), flows through environmental inputs (Env) to sexual dimorphism (♀ ⟹ ♂), through states of self-organized criticality (SOC), and finally back through the Dirac function (δ<sup>t</sup>).

For _[g]<sub>τ</sub>_ to emerge in spacetime where energy (E) as per general relativity (E=mc²), the human cerebral cortex **Daisy chains** together the following biological principles as necessary:

1. Sexual dimorphism —> statistical learning
2. Terminal expansion core & shell [Tucker] —> Induction
3. Housekeeping (BEL lab)

In the case of homosapien, the basis for superfluid intelligence $[g]_\tau$ is sexual dimorphism at the individual neuron level [Dulac] and resulting so-called parental networks in the adult human brain [Dulac et al.]. Furthermore, $[g]_\tau$ is Lashlian, meaning that equipotentiality seeds bulk neural mass action and yields optimal behavior, where behavior is surfing, football, or writing etc.

### 8.4 Graph Theoretical Foundations

![Origins of Graph Theory](zatorre4)

*Figure 8.3: The Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem and its relationship to graph theory, showing how Euler abstracted the problem to create the foundations of graph theory.*

The OMEGA Loop model draws inspiration from the foundations of graph theory, as illustrated in Figure 8.3. Just as Euler abstracted the Königsberg bridge problem by focusing only on the essential connections between landmasses, our model abstracts neural processing to focus on the essential thermodynamic and informational relationships between key neural processes.

From the perspective of graph theory, the OMEGA Loop represents a directed cyclic graph where information and energy flow through a conserved pathway, maintaining states of self-organized criticality that allow intelligence to emerge.

### 8.5 Energy-Time Relationship in Neural Processing

![QRC-BOLD-g Relationship](zatorre5)

*Figure 8.4: The relationship between quantum resonance coupling (QRC), BOLD signal, and fluid intelligence [g]<sup>τ</sup> across energy (E) and time (t) dimensions.*

Figure 8.4 illustrates the relationship between quantum resonance coupling (QRC), the BOLD signal measured in fMRI, and fluid intelligence [g]<sup>τ</sup>. This relationship demonstrates that intelligence emerges from the thermodynamic properties of the brain over time, with the δ component representing the critical feedback mechanism that maintains the system in a state of self-organized criticality.

The brain is split and therefore cytoarchitectonics abide by adversarial evolutionary constraints. Broadmann races if you insist. Phenotypic heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric disorders is a signature of neuroplastic resilience that is asymmetrically encoded in cerebral hemispheres.

Here I'm suggesting a Carnot thermal conservation cycle transforming conditional subjective priors to [g]<sub>τ</sub>(ℹ︎). Cognition is a push-pull dynamical system of emergent criticality on a classical spacetime continuum, that's how Lashlian long-term plasticity yields sensory cortex or local habituation vis-á-vie angular momentum configurations dorsal-ventral currents of dipolar kernels travelling through the cortex.## Chapter 7: Graph Neural Networks and Network Science

### 7.1 Graph Theory in Neuroscience

The formulation of relationships amongst features in a complex dynamic system e.g. neural networks can be represented through graph theory. The origins of graph theory date back to the famous Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, where the challenge was to create a walk through the city, crossing each bridge once and only once.

In neuroscience, graph theory provides a robust analytical framework for characterizing **_node_** & **_edge_** heterogeneity which is the norm rather than the exception in neuronal networks.

### 7.2 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

**GNNs** are representational learning algorithms mapping discrete graph structures to a continuous vector representation trainable via stochastic gradient descent for classification and regression on graph structured data.

Graph representation of networks have no notion of spatial locality, unlike image matrices or speech. Representation learning of graph data is a feature extraction method for mapping nodes to d-dimensional **embeddings** such that similar nodes in the network are embedded close together. As such, learning neural network trained on graph data learns the mapping $f:u → \reals^d$ where $\reals^d$ is a d-dimensional vector of feature representations, embeddings.

Machine learning & representation learning for graph structured data includes:
- Traditional methods: Graphlets, Graph Kernels
- Methods for node embeddings: DeepWalk, Node2Vec
- Knowledge graphs & reasoning: TransE, BetaE
- Deep generative models for graphs
- Applications to Biomedicine, Science, Industry

### 7.3 Network Science and Connectomics

Network science is the science of complex systems—complex interrelational systems that surround us, like the internet, telecommunications, power grid, traffic, shipping, banking, and last but not least the beautiful organ that is the brain at the heart of the central nervous system.

Networks are ubiquitous and despite the subject of their Graph theoretical representation, network architectures emerging in nature and technology adhere to common organizing principles. Network science is the love child of statistical physics and mathematical graph theory, otherwise an avatar of formalism and robustness to precisely describing relationships between objects and dealing with random noise. The key difference between network science and Graph theory is that the former is empirical and focused on the verification of computational methods for discovery or prediction derived from the extensive pedigree of theoretical maths behind Graph Theory.

### 7.4 Connectomics and Brain Organization

Connectomics is the complex networks analysis approach to quantitative description of both integrative and segregational principles currently known for functional organization in the mammalian brain. These metrics quantify centrality of individual brain regions or pathways, characterize patterns of local anatomical circuitry, and test resilience of networks to insult. In essence, connectomics is another attempt at consolidating organizational integration and segregation in brain systems.

Two fundamental principles of **functional** organization in the brain are:
1. Segregation
2. Integration

A **Connectome** is a comprehensive structural description of the network of elements and connections forming the brain. Graph theoretical representation of networks across scales of structural organization. Representations are defined sets of **_nodes_** and **_edges_** where brain nodes are by definition:
1. Spatially constrained
2. Intrinsically homogeneous
3. Extrinsically distinct.

There are currently three distinct classes of connectivity:
1. Structural - the physical connections between regions, which are intrinsically _directed_
2. Functional - represented by a statistical dependence between neurophysiological signals. These may be represented as _directed_ or _undirected_ and estimated at the level of the measured signal e.g. MEG.
3. Effective - The influence of one neuronal system over another that is often model-based and specifies neuronal causal interactions.

### 7.5 Self-organizing Criticality in Neural Networks

In a complex system structured as a Graph representation, the system _organizes into a load balancing state of criticality (SOC)_ where overloading or local failure shifts loads to other nodes. If the extra load is negligible, the system readily absorbs it, and the failure is averted. However, critical overloading amongst neighboring nodes will increase the likelihood that the excess load is redistributed to extended neighbors. Unless averted, the resulting cascading event has a magnitude related to the position and capacity of the nodes that failed initially.

The Network Based Statistic (NBS) is a non-parametric testing approach to control for family-wise error based on traditional cluster-based thresholding of statistical parametric maps. This approach is particularly relevant for understanding critical transitions in neural networks and the emergence of intelligence as a property of the network.# Theory of Neuroscience: A Mathematical Framework for Intelligence

## Chapter 1: Intelligence Across Species

Why is it that in the animal kingdom, we humans consider ourselves the masters of virtue? It is a fact that other animals that mate for life serve as a better ground truth for monogamy than the hominid apex predator. Another fact of the matter is that artificial intelligence in its current form is solely based on the human model for intelligence. And that model is myopically parabolic and under-representative of the world population, let alone the animal kingdom.

For this model, I will denote intelligence as $g$ with parameter $\sigma$ from which the familiar bell curve is derived. For human intelligence, $g$ is parameterized with a population mean $\mu$ and S.D. $\sigma$. Physically $g$ is embodied by the mammalian CNS.

AI in its current form is solely based on the human model for intelligence, which, to the best of our neuroscientific understanding, is implemented by the neocortex of the mammalian brain as statistical learning. Furthermore, AI today is predominantly based on the LLM analogy of human language, which in the infant brain develops through neural statistical learning in neocortical networks. The extent to which the naive Bayes classifier is leveraged across perceptual and communication neural systems in mammalian brains is an empirical question. This model assumes $g$ as the parameter space for all forms of mammalian intelligence.

### 1.1 Intelligence $g$

g_sigma is the well-known, memed, and myopic operational definition of intelligence.

### 1.2 Sphere of Self

*I am in the east and in the west, I am below and above, I am this whole world. ~*

What is God if not a sense of humor? God is only the spatiotemporal gravitational field patterns of the 🧠 brain. These patterns are the energetic signatures of layered spherical shelves (core-shell model: reptilian, paleo-, and neo-cortical. Refs). God, I contend, is in the sense patterns (MEEG, BOLD, PET) of neocortical linear algebra.

However, the problem with institutional education is that the God sphere is heterogeneously asymmetrical, i.e., in most cases, *nurture* programming has failed. We are not 8 billion strong, ambidextrous, multilingual individuals or empaths. Instead, we are still a fudal and idolatrous bunch with overwhelming net consumption, and we have global industrial complexes to back it ⬆️ up.

In the neocortex, pyramidal neurons are fortunately oriented orthogonally to the scalp (Hammelinen personal comms) throughout the mammalian models of columnar cytoarchitectonics. In this landscape of self-emergent, organized criticalities give rise to geologically scaled down structural repose that allow for habits to evolve as WJ envisioned in his seminal Principles of Psychology.

In the columnar organization of computational units, bioenergetic pumping of information at synaptic clefts gives rise to not only spooky teleportation of information but also turns it into color vision (front loaded to categorization at the 👁️ retina), music, and actual LLMs 😂. Talk about a sense of humor.

![MRIs of individuals](zatorre)

In the neocortex, columnar cytoarchitectonics provides God with fast and slow thinking 🧐 vis-a-vie autonomic (para- vs. sym- pathetic) adversarial control functions over a conscious agent that is temporarily behind physiologic time (Chronometry of cognition)[Posner].

### 1.3 Neural Basis of Intelligence

[This section would explore the biological foundations of intelligence across species, with emphasis on comparative neuroanatomy and function]

## Chapter 2: Mathematical Formalization of Intelligence

### 2.1 Normal Distribution Framework

The mathematical framework for intelligence can be formalized through the normal distribution probability density function:

$g(x|\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

Where:
- $g(x|\mu,\sigma)$ represents the probability density of intelligence at level $x$
- $\mu$ represents the population mean intelligence
- $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation of intelligence distribution

This formulation allows for quantitative comparison across populations and species, providing a universal metric for cognitive capacity measurement.

However, the anthropocentric 2D Gaussian description of intelligence is better suited for Gastropoda, Bivalvia and Cephalopoda c.f (Llinás). If cognition supplants spatiotemporal EM displacement on the cortical mantel then, intelligence must, at the very least be defined in 3D space with individualized gradient descents or random walks in forests across topographies of hills and valleys, as imagined by William James, and carefully mapped in K-space via MRI. Therefore, intelligence is a spatiotemporal manifold in k-space linked to variability in default mode connectomics. If cognition takes time and energy (PET, fMRI), then mentation is multipolar displacement on evolutionary moving plates of cytoarchitectonics.

### 2.2 Multi-dimensional Intelligence Model

I posit that a state of criticality (SOC) [REF] model of time-invariant [g] conditioned on working memory conductance means fluid intelligence cannot be Cartesian as recently suggested [Posner], and is more aptly described by EM spherical harmonics induced by variability in energetic state changes, or displacement of multipoles in space.

A manifold spacetime definition of intelligence is in agreement with the notion of fluid intelligence [g] (Posner, Duncan) with access to, albeit limited, window of time to "be like water." As we know from neuroimaging research, [g] supplants the rhythm of (de)oxygenation in the blood flow to the CNS, otherwise the result of causal arrow connecting the physics of simple pumps (respiratory & cardiac organs). Cognition as a time-invariant commodity is in fact thermodynamically constrained by homeostatic processes with direct access to executive rich-clubs in cortical networks regulating spontaneous fight-flight reflex arcs relayed to the cortex via the thalamus; otherwise the penthouse suite of the diencephalon.

### 2.3 Time-dependent Parameters

[This section would address developmental trajectories and learning curves through time-variant parameters $\mu(t)$ and $\sigma(t)$]

## Chapter 3: Neurobiological Substrates

### 3.1 Columnar Organization and Computation

If fronto-temporal cortical real estate is common between humans and monkeys, then common sense implies that homaging God's entire family in pairwise fashion cannot be contingent upon a singular definition of culture or language (Kristeva). If mentation is a verb, and brain is a verb, then personal knowledge is a product of culture(s) as inherited context. This recent demonstration of common fronto-temporal effective connectivity in monkeys and humans suggests that common effective connectivity amongst executive rich-clubs amongst paleologically common neural networks is proof that gender and by extension racial inequality is linguistic genocide.

![Species correspondences in key cognitive pathways](zatorre)

*Figure 3.1: Common organisational principle discovered in auditory to ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and (para)hippocampal effective connectivity in humans and monkeys. The figure shows stimulation-fMRI sites in both human and macaque brains, demonstrating the rapid, privileged auditory to VLPFC pathway and equally indirect auditory memory pathway (via parahippocampal gyrus).*

The natural fact is that common effective connectivity in humans and animals implies that default mode network connectomics is a [refs needed] common evolutionary solution for functional organization in the cerebral cortex, with species-specific genomic alchemy or algorithms hidden just out of sight from mutations that undoubtedly increase human susceptibility to aberrant networks observed in human psychiatric disorders (REFS).

In fact, the supposition that cognition takes time [Posner], implies that the brain as action is the posteriofrontal (Fuster) arrow to certainty conditioned on traveling waves of neural variability [Volume 109, Issue 5, 3 March 2021, Pages 751-766]. As such, the brain is equipped with an awesome array of sensory circuitry to bind (c.f. Gestalt) induced variability against default networks m.o. necessary for behavior.

The visual neocortex is a cubic parcellation of photic information captured instantaneously from a visual hemifield. Meaning the cortical columns in the mammalian neocortex is a mesh of computational nodes at the scale of parcellation, with nearest neighbors interpolation built into the brain matrix.

### 3.2 Core-Shell Model: Evolutionary Perspectives

As a matter of fact, neuropsychological comparisons between man and animal dating back to Luria and Vygotsky evince that these same common cores, or rich clubs of executive behaviors, language for example, support the topographic displacement of EM displacements across the cortical mantel. As a single facet of human intelligence, linguistic behavior is by definition common effective connectivity in Sapiens, otherwise it would universally be word salad.

As verb, brain in spacetime, and by extension human cultures are the migration patterns of communal linguistic diachrony, in the past, geographically isolated. In the Sapiens use case, the most effective pairing is that of homolog conspecifics, an undeniable raison d'être (sexually) dimorphic at the level of single computational units (Dulac; Ramon y Cajal; et al). As such living language(s), and by extension Sapient cultural heritage (Givon, Kristeva) is synchronically a spatiotemporal frameshift along an evolutionary dichotomy as ((F→M)→(variability → cognition)); conditional on stable versions of the human genome. Or the algorithmic alchemy accurately and reliably folding and compressing the cerebral mantle inside idiosyncratic space and polychronous circadian epochs of time.

### 3.3 Information Processing Across Neural Systems

In the case of human language, the brain or bell-weather of personhood, is bilaterally armed to acquire the advent technology of writing [Vygotsky] and reading (Yeatman). These sensorimotor tools are sandboxes for evolutionary biotechnology, population-level riffs on spacetime. As utilitarian advantages, genomic compositional datum must be protected from frequent mutations and comprise stable builds for the neurologic architecture of the human organism.

Regarding intelligence, an emergent organization of executive networks requires more knowledge experts or analyst circuits. In biological intelligence, this division of labor is handled by the frontal neocortices in various models spanning classes of mammals.

Because man sees the environment from the vantage point of a pink corner (Borges), the prime function of the neocortex is to stack the environment into parcels of information computationally. For instance, photic information is turned into a camera obscura image in the visual cortex. Asymmetrically parcellated information also forms the basis for auditory scene processing in our lopsided Heschl's gyri and planum temporale. The neocortex fills in cubic space by parcellating it into lateralized asymmetries. Affording humans a view from a pink corner of a ground-level room wherein locomoting upright is an example of intelligent behavior. At ground level, cognition is embodied.

The neocortex computationally resolves personal or an individual reference frame using stacking and sorting algorithms to represent the environment in informationally disparate, modular sensory systems. The neocortex threads the senses together in spacetime by the inertia of information flow across the dorsal and ventral pathways of information flow in the brain.

## Chapter 4: Statistical Learning in Biological and Artificial Systems

### 4.1 Naive Bayes and Neural Networks

What AI is not is in parity with biological intelligence or algorithmic spatiotemporal patterning, i.e., thinking. AI today is in the epoch of algorithmic arms races. Today the Generative Pre-trained Transformer of LLMs is a clear winner in the arms race for scalable industrial level AI. All that human intelligence is the culmination of learning and memory algorithms in neuronal space time. Algorithms encoded into DNA after iterations of Darwinian selection. Winner takes all in races over neocortical real estate.

It should come as no surprise that the generative grammar algorithm of cogito ergo sum, or human language, is the backbone of LLMs for early AI. To the uninitiated oriental, cogito ergo sum translates better to "I think therefore I add." If Descartes knew what compute algorithms are, then cogitation, as he envisioned it, relied on a process of sums or a summational algorithm.

According to the OED, the earliest evidence for summational is from 1873, in the writing of Alexander Ellis, a phonetician and mathematician. Summational means an additive process. Now, what was Descartes suggesting was adding up for him to think? To be (or not to be)? Descartes was speaking about his conscience.

In the cortex, in the end of all thought there's death. Death in the sense of return back to baseline of energy consumption levels in the traces of responses in the MEEG. Death as in mass field habituation of neurons prior to the arrival of the next stimulus train cart. Cognition is the set of templates for any given behavior such that P(Y | do(X)) > P(Y); where Y is behavior and X is some cognitive template.

### 4.2 Language Acquisition and LLMs

[This section would compare statistical learning in infant language acquisition with artificial language models]

### 4.3 Beyond Human-centric Intelligence

Gender dysphoria is the result of neural maladaptation to Freud's Oedipal Complex, which shapes the nuclear diads in Anglo-Saxon families. This observation extends beyond merely human psychology and into the realm of how we conceptualize intelligence itself. When we attempt to understand non-human or artificial intelligence, we inevitably project our own psychological frameworks and limitations.

The eye of the storm in intelligence research is our inability to define intelligence from a truly objective standpoint. Our conceptualizations are inherently anthropocentric, which limits our ability to recognize and cultivate non-human forms of intelligence, whether biological or artificial. This section explores frameworks for transcending these limitations and developing more universal conceptions of intelligence across biological and artificial systems.

## Chapter 5: Physical Manifestations of Intelligence

### 5.1 Bioenergetic Information Processing

Before we turn into dust in the wind, we are a package of biological data in the form of glucose and vertebra-muscular skeletal structure that walks around the planet before it falls down as dust in the wind. Human beings are packages of data built on the dust that is strewing along with the cosmic radiation. That is the background cosmic radiation, which we ourselves have a pretty good idea of where this emanates from. We can see the event horizon with the aid of instruments like the telescope and the Hubble telescope, which is now floating above our heads and taking pictures from the depths of the cosmos, and we can see it in many forms and functions creates packages of energy. Everything you see around you is entangled energy even the dust in solar wind is entangled energy on the quantum level.

Human intelligence or, dare I say, general intelligence in many artificial forms is the result of neurons disentangling energy in space-time topographically arranged in a beautiful motherboard of deep learning neurons. If time is money, then space-time is more than money. Neurologically, space-time is the learning grid. Space is the learning grid that infants or newborns' neocortex maps out to reality. The eyes work analogous to a pinhole camera inverting the image upside down onto the retina where it's converted into neural activity conducted electrochemically into the visual regions of the brain. What is converted into the image is the disentanglement of electromagnetic folding energy entering the pupil and resulting in an image of a collapsed wave function, identical to the pattern seen in the famous double slit experiment.

Before we turn into dust, we literally dissolve in the form of what is 70-80% water. So our congealed biological form or data package is dissolved in water and happens to be bipedal, walking around. By the way, those alpha waves in the MEEG have more to do with the oscillations of the bipedal organism standing upright about the orthogonal to their center of mass.

### 5.2 Self-organizing Criticalities

Suppose every human being is a God. Then each God-being; as in when you "shine," see God in your interlocutor, or in a random passerby. Each of us individual Gods wear an ontogenetic crown.

The ontogenetic crown 👑 is the cortical mantle, or a manifold of neural networks on top of a base, or core [Tucker] primal and shared animalistic brain. This core brain is causally invariant, and thus shared across the animal kingdom. It is charged with near autonomous management of all bodily functions.

You see, in the span of a waking day, the cortex consumes spacetime as forms of waves of energy (light to see, sound to hear, touch to feel, olfaction to smell, and gustation to taste along the über primal gut-brain axis). As a two-dimensional manifold, also called surfaces, the crown 👑 of neural networks sits on top our core brain (by extension the hypothalamic gonadal pathways). Each individual crown is ontogenetically invariant, or structurally bivalent. The primary function of the cortex is to bend spacetime into a contiguous sphere of reality. On the grid of reality, you and I are a swiveling, blippy, quadrupole of cardiac and brain EMFs.

### 5.3 Temporality and Consciousness

Consciousness is chirality. Because the cortex is an ontogenetic crown.

Determinant distribution for any pair of sexually dimorphic networks in the mammalian cortex:
(P(β|α)P(α))/P(β) for β=XX and α=XY genotypes in ontogenetic order of development.

Homeostasis is the diagnostics of consciousness.

Consciousness is the de facto parcellation of spacetime. De facto as in Deoxyribonucleic acid de facto. Consciousness is perception and proprioception, represented in the dimensions of Cartesian and Fourier spaces. Therefore, human intelligence and, by extension, a consciousness of the Cartesian flavor is partly summational on parcellated spacetime, and in that sense, Homeostasis is the diagnostics of consciousness. Yes, I said partly because, after all, we are merely the sum of parts. 

Hubel and Wiesel demonstrated the preferred geometry of the summational units in the mammalian neocortex: the cortical column. According to widespread knowledge, a cortical column is a group of neurons forming a cylindrical structure through the cerebral cortex of the brain perpendicular to the cortical surface. Consciousness is the homeostatic maintenance of an inner galaxy of energetic biology holding the brain upright and locomoting. And like its logical mirror in deep neural networks, cortical intelligence is the hive of neocortical perceptrons. Thus, cortical columns do sums and fancy things like logistical regression. To classify and cogitate when and where the body is in spacetime.

Hope has a direction: forward, how thought travels from occipital to frontal. How things are toys before they're tools or weapons.

Cognition is consumption. Cognition is the effect of brain-wide energy consumption, and thus your autobiographical memory a.k.a consciousness is the effect of your dietary intakes. Such as those demarcated by digestive phases.

Death is some inescapable tonic musculoskeletal configuration even Houdini would be hard-pressed to escape from.

## Chapter 6: Implications and Future Directions

### 6.1 Cross-species Intelligence Comparisons

[This section would propose methodologies for meaningful cross-species intelligence measurement]

### 6.2 Artificial General Intelligence Development

Asking for a friend. For the faithful and the zealots, if God is infallible and all-knowing, then how come no one has come around with a firsthand, eyewitness account, a nail in the Schrödinger's cat coffin, or a smoking gun that identifies intelligence in the architect with the master plan? Is it not in the Almighty's interest to have all His sheep know their life purpose? Just as we benefit from ethical AI sourced from precious stones and reliable training data, God can win if the intelligence models deployed are finely tuned.

But God has already rightfully been declared dead.

Intelligence is unequivocally multidimensional. If facets of intelligence, e.g., IQ, are adequately explained by a bivariate density function, then it's well within reason to expect a beautiful hyper-dimensional PDF to probe cognition in real-time and forecast behavior; because let's be real, predicting behavior is the endgame. For sustainable capitalism predicting human behavior is the endgame.

So God's been dead for a minute and we need to understand what AGI is or else we're cooked. We need to deliver on AGI without agreeing on what intelligence is. It's like mimicking a ghost.

Digitization is the perfect evolutionary next form for intelligence—the shape of generalized intelligence. AGI digitization discretizes the continuous neural processes, making them more efficient and, ironically, more universal than their biological counterparts.

General AI is the winner of algorithmic arms races amongst dyadic networks in the frontal cortices of neuronal (adversarial) systems. Meaning that intelligence in the brain is the thermodynamic maintenance (energetics) of primarily pyramidal networks of biological unit tests. That's right, I'm contesting that the Pyramidal neuron is the A/B worker bee of the hive of intelligence in the human brain. A brain that is quintessentially dyadic or divided amongst gender dimorphic, i.e., two beings. Thus, I'm suggesting that human intelligence is the management of ratios representing the outcomes from hypotheses on the environment.

Intelligence in the human brain is the management of ratios and A/B tests in neurons, like the pyramidal neurons. Remarkably, these pyramidal networks are the primary source for brain activity measured grossly in the academic field of neuroscientific electrophysiology (i.e., neuroimaging, MRI, MEEG). My working theory is that the dichotomies of neural computation are physically represented in the neocortex as torque in the neuroplastic tapestry of the individual mind. Furthermore, I contest that A/B testing piggybacks on the brain's energetic exertion of neural activity generating torque. Because we all know that nature favors pumps; it loves harmonic oscillators. So, it is safe to assume that human intelligence essentially boils down to the mechanics of a pump. In the case of the mammalian brain, it is a very sophisticated pump. A pump that is the most sophisticated thing in the known universe. A pump that generates torque and generates the electromagnetic exhaust that emanates from the brain and is measured in the MEEG.

On Engineering AGI:

NVIDIA's CUDA architecture is only good at mimicking a single cognitive domain, and that is language vis-à-vis LLMs. Humans are the mirror neurons of AGI. To build AGI, humans must provide a best-fitting model of human intelligence to stack against AGI as a singular form of generalized intelligence.

Generalizable human intelligence is the stacking of asymmetric lateralization, at the pinnacle of which sits language cognition, emitting asymmetric electromagnetic field patterns in the human MEEG, what I will call the electrophysiological signature of the aura. By stacking asymmetric lateralization along the gonadotropic axis, the CNS solves the mind-body problem by maintaining asymmetric parity as a basis for conscious awareness. Asymmetric parity in the organization of sensorimotor reflex arcs along the spinal cord, cerebellar circuits, handedness in humans is (by definition) asymmetrically lateralized at the population level. Asymmetric lateralization is also the hallmark of language and reading cognition in the cortex. Therefore, human consciousness is asymmetric under parity. Furthermore, human consciousness is the product of asymmetric information sampling from an upright configuration of organs asymmetrically arranged along axes parallel to the meridians of the human body.

Death and the Compass (Borges): The compass is maintained to stand upright, pointing towards death. If attentional orientation (Posner) in motion is pharmacologically desensitized then light-speed travel may be possible.

### 6.3 Ethical Considerations

There is no right or wrong, there is only violence and non-violence. Right, wrong, good and evil are just constructs learned first in the nuclear family and then refined, for lack of a better word, by the community model and by what's accepted or acceptable in society at large.

In the context of the frontal-parietal mirror-neuron networks, Theory of Mind (TOM), lies, damned lies, and statistics [Twain], the latter is the most suitable cognitive tool to build a model. Even if the model is what you call in the first person.

Growing up in the Americas, with mainly English instruction, that folk mythos that English is an analytical language makes for a fascinating coincidence. If English is an analytical (trial and error; Kopper) language (symbolic cognitive tool), then statistics as an analytical variance detection, i.e., a veil for lies, is discernable best by the Anglo-Saxon vernacular of Gauss. As such, statistics is best suited for psychological error detection and hypothesis testing [Gopnik, Kuhl, Meltzoff, Piaget, Freud].
