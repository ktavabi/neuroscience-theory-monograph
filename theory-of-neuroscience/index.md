## Introduction

This monograph presents a comprehensive theory of neuroscience, exploring the mathematical foundations of intelligence across biological and artificial systems. Drawing from diverse fields including cognitive neuroscience, statistics, physics, and philosophy, we develop a unified framework for understanding intelligence as a property emerging from complex neural systems.

The work spans from biological implementations in mammalian brains to artificial implementations in computational systems, with particular attention to the underlying mathematical principles that govern intelligent behavior across these domains.
