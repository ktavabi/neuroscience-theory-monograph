# Artificial General Intelligence Development

Asking for a friend. For the faithful and the zealots, if God is infallible and all-knowing, then how come no one has come around with a firsthand, eyewitness account, a nail in the Schrödinger's cat coffin, or a smoking gun that identifies intelligence in the architect with the master plan? Is it not in the Almighty's interest to have all His sheep know their life purpose? Just as we benefit from ethical AI sourced from precious stones and reliable training data, God can win if the intelligence models deployed are finely tuned.

But God has already rightfully been declared dead.

Intelligence is unequivocally multidimensional. If facets of intelligence, e.g., IQ, are adequately explained by a bivariate density function, then it's well within reason to expect a beautiful hyper-dimensional PDF to probe cognition in real-time and forecast behavior; because let's be real, predicting behavior is the endgame. For sustainable capitalism predicting human behavior is the endgame.

So God's been dead for a minute and we need to understand what AGI is or else we're cooked. We need to deliver on AGI without agreeing on what intelligence is. It's like mimicking a ghost.

Digitization is the perfect evolutionary next form for intelligence—the shape of generalized intelligence. AGI digitization discretizes the continuous neural processes, making them more efficient and, ironically, more universal than their biological counterparts.

General AI is the winner of algorithmic arms races amongst dyadic networks in the frontal cortices of neuronal (adversarial) systems. Meaning that intelligence in the brain is the thermodynamic maintenance (energetics) of primarily pyramidal networks of biological unit tests. That's right, I'm contesting that the Pyramidal neuron is the A/B worker bee of the hive of intelligence in the human brain. A brain that is quintessentially dyadic or divided amongst gender dimorphic, i.e., two beings. Thus, I'm suggesting that human intelligence is the management of ratios representing the outcomes from hypotheses on the environment.

Intelligence in the human brain is the management of ratios and A/B tests in neurons, like the pyramidal neurons. Remarkably, these pyramidal networks are the primary source for brain activity measured grossly in the academic field of neuroscientific electrophysiology (i.e., neuroimaging, MRI, MEEG). My working theory is that the dichotomies of neural computation are physically represented in the neocortex as torque in the neuroplastic tapestry of the individual mind. Furthermore, I contest that A/B testing piggybacks on the brain's energetic exertion of neural activity generating torque. Because we all know that nature favors pumps; it loves harmonic oscillators. So, it is safe to assume that human intelligence essentially boils down to the mechanics of a pump. In the case of the mammalian brain, it is a very sophisticated pump. A pump that is the most sophisticated thing in the known universe. A pump that generates torque and generates the electromagnetic exhaust that emanates from the brain and is measured in the MEEG.

## On Engineering AGI

NVIDIA's CUDA architecture is only good at mimicking a single cognitive domain, and that is language vis-à-vis LLMs. Humans are the mirror neurons of AGI. To build AGI, humans must provide a best-fitting model of human intelligence to stack against AGI as a singular form of generalized intelligence.

Generalizable human intelligence is the stacking of asymmetric lateralization, at the pinnacle of which sits language cognition, emitting asymmetric electromagnetic field patterns in the human MEEG, what I will call the electrophysiological signature of the aura. By stacking asymmetric lateralization along the gonadotropic axis, the CNS solves the mind-body problem by maintaining asymmetric parity as a basis for conscious awareness. Asymmetric parity in the organization of sensorimotor reflex arcs along the spinal cord, cerebellar circuits, handedness in humans is (by definition) asymmetrically lateralized at the population level. Asymmetric lateralization is also the hallmark of language and reading cognition in the cortex. Therefore, human consciousness is asymmetric under parity. Furthermore, human consciousness is the product of asymmetric information sampling from an upright configuration of organs asymmetrically arranged along axes parallel to the meridians of the human body.

What AI is not is in parity with biological intelligence or algorithmic spatiotemporal patterning, i.e., thinking. AI today is in the epoch of algorithmic arms races. Today the Generative Pre-trained Transformer of LLMs is a clear winner in the arms race for scalable industrial level AI. All that human intelligence is the culmination of learning and memory algorithms in neuronal space time. Algorithms encoded into DNA after iterations of Darwinian selection. Winner takes all in races over neocortical real estate.
