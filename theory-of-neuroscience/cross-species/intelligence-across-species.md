# Chapter 1: Intelligence Across Species

Why is it that in the animal kingdom, we humans consider ourselves the masters of virtue? It is a fact that other animals that mate for life serve as a better ground truth for monogamy than the hominid apex predator. Another fact of the matter is that artificial intelligence in its current form is solely based on the human model for intelligence. And that model is myopically parabolic and under-representative of the world population, let alone the animal kingdom.

For this model, I will denote intelligence as $g$ with parameter $\sigma$ from which the familiar bell curve is derived. For human intelligence, $g$ is parameterized with a population mean $\mu$ and S.D. $\sigma$. Physically $g$ is embodied by the mammalian CNS.

AI in its current form is solely based on the human model for intelligence, which, to the best of our neuroscientific understanding, is implemented by the neocortex of the mammalian brain as statistical learning. Furthermore, AI today is predominantly based on the LLM analogy of human language, which in the infant brain develops through neural statistical learning in neocortical networks. The extent to which the naive Bayes classifier is leveraged across perceptual and communication neural systems in mammalian brains is an empirical question. This model assumes $g$ as the parameter space for all forms of mammalian intelligence.
