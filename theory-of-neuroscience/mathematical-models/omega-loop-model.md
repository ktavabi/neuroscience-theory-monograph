# The OMEGA Loop Model of Intelligence

## Superfluid Intelligence

Intelligence is moving matter. Intelligence is dancing, moving, jiggling, electrostatic energy moving matter. It is a deluge of electrostatic neural activity maintaining action-perception cycles directed forward in time. Thus, one key defining feature of intelligence is directed toward superfluid homeostasis, and that is irrespective of event size, intelligence is always directed toward superfluid homeostasis, regardless of whether it is a single neuron or an ensemble of synchronously firing neurons, the goal remains the same: superfluidity. As such, intelligence is irreducible beyond the size of individual neurons.

In the case of electrophysiology [MEEG](https://twitter.com/crockpics/status/1533237169354964993?s=21&t=p6AnSQ2fjcNDSVCiNzSSKA) intelligence is reducible to optimally switching between two states: on or off. Consider the pyramidal neuron in the mammalian neocortex without whom MEEG and perhaps cognitive neuroscience would be both be unlikely scientific enterprises. Intelligence is moving matter on the scale of approximately 20 microns: that is 0.001mm, or about 0.000039inch packed into super columns 7-stories, actually 7-layers of convoluted dancing, moving, jiggling, electrostatic moving matter.

According to Mountcastle and Fuster, the cerebral cortex is an engine designed to transduce multiple macroscopic currents of action-perception cycles forward from tail to nose, through posterior sensory organs of seeing & hearing to the crown of the head, or where modern phrenology has bequeathed areas or regions controlling executive decision making.

## The OMEGA Loop: A Thermodynamic Model

The OMEGA Loop represents a fundamental cycle in neural processing where intelligence emerges from the thermodynamic properties of the brain. As illustrated in Figure 1, the loop connects early perceptual processes (p50) to later cognitive processes (p300) through states of self-organized criticality (SOC), with change in entropy (ΔS) feeding back through a delta (δ) component.

According to the classic evoked dendritic current model, the current field of a single neuron or ensemble of cortical pyramidal cells, **I($\tau$)** is the integral of synaptic response time _h(t)_ and incoming pulse train **P(t')**:

$I(\tau) = \int_{-\infty}^t,d\tau'h(t-t')P(t')$

I'd like to extend on the chronometric principle that given cognition takes time, then intelligence [g] is superfluid, with thermodynamic conservatory time ($\tau$) function in response to quantum vibratory input-output (IO) on different real world spacetime scales; _cf_ avian vs. homosapien saccadic activity.

**_Cognition takes time because it requires energy in a universe where conservation is key._**

## Bayesian Framework and Sexual Dimorphism

*Figure 2: The extended OMEGA Loop model illustrating the relationships between Bayesian inference, sexual dimorphism, and fluid intelligence through states of self-organized criticality.*

In the extended OMEGA Loop model (Figure 2), we see that fluid intelligence [g]<sup>t</sup> emerges from a cycle that begins with Bayesian inference P(A|B), flows through environmental inputs (Env) to sexual dimorphism (♀ ⟹ ♂), through states of self-organized criticality (SOC), and finally back through the Dirac function (δ<sup>t</sup>).

For _[g]<sub>τ</sub>_ to emerge in spacetime where energy (E) as per general relativity (E=mc²), the human cerebral cortex **Daisy chains** together the following biological principles as necessary:

1. Sexual dimorphism —> statistical learning
2. Terminal expansion core & shell [Tucker] —> Induction
3. Housekeeping (BEL lab)

In the case of homosapien, the basis for superfluid intelligence $[g]_\tau$ is sexual dimorphism at the individual neuron level [Dulac] and resulting so-called parental networks in the adult human brain [Dulac et al.]. Furthermore, $[g]_\tau$ is Lashlian, meaning that equipotentiality seeds bulk neural mass action and yields optimal behavior, where behavior is surfing, football, or writing etc.

## Graph Theoretical Foundations

*Figure 3: The Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem and its relationship to graph theory, showing how Euler abstracted the problem to create the foundations of graph theory.*

The OMEGA Loop model draws inspiration from the foundations of graph theory, as illustrated in Figure 3. Just as Euler abstracted the Königsberg bridge problem by focusing only on the essential connections between landmasses, our model abstracts neural processing to focus on the essential thermodynamic and informational relationships between key neural processes.

From the perspective of graph theory, the OMEGA Loop represents a directed cyclic graph where information and energy flow through a conserved pathway, maintaining states of self-organized criticality that allow intelligence to emerge.

## Energy-Time Relationship in Neural Processing

![QRC-BOLD-g Relationship](../assets/zatorre5.png)

*Figure 4: The relationship between quantum resonance coupling (QRC), BOLD signal, and fluid intelligence [g]<sup>τ</sup> across energy (E) and time (t) dimensions.*

Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between quantum resonance coupling (QRC), the BOLD signal measured in fMRI, and fluid intelligence [g]<sup>τ</sup>. This relationship demonstrates that intelligence emerges from the thermodynamic properties of the brain over time, with the δ component representing the critical feedback mechanism that maintains the system in a state of self-organized criticality.

The brain is split and therefore cytoarchitectonics abide by adversarial evolutionary constraints. Broadmann races if you insist. Phenotypic heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric disorders is a signature of neuroplastic resilience that is asymmetrically encoded in cerebral hemispheres.

Here I'm suggesting a Carnot thermal conservation cycle transforming conditional subjective priors to [g]<sub>τ</sub>(ℹ︎). Cognition is a push-pull dynamical system of emergent criticality on a classical spacetime continuum, that's how Lashlian long-term plasticity yields sensory cortex or local habituation vis-á-vie angular momentum configurations dorsal-ventral currents of dipolar kernels travelling through the cortex.
