# Normal Distribution Framework

The mathematical framework for intelligence can be formalized through the normal distribution probability density function:

$g(x|\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}$

Where:
- $g(x|\mu,\sigma)$ represents the probability density of intelligence at level $x$
- $\mu$ represents the population mean intelligence
- $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation of intelligence distribution

This formulation allows for quantitative comparison across populations and species, providing a universal metric for cognitive capacity measurement.

However, the anthropocentric 2D Gaussian description of intelligence is better suited for Gastropoda, Bivalvia and Cephalopoda c.f (Llin√°s). If cognition supplants spatiotemporal EM displacement on the cortical mantel then, intelligence must, at the very least be defined in 3D space with individualized gradient descents or random walks in forests across topographies of hills and valleys, as imagined by William James, and carefully mapped in K-space via MRI. Therefore, intelligence is a spatiotemporal manifold in k-space linked to variability in default mode connectomics.

If cognition takes time and energy (PET, fMRI), then mentation is multipolar displacement on evolutionary moving plates of cytoarchitectonics.
