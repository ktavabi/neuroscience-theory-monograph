# Columnar Organization and Computation

If fronto-temporal cortical real estate is common between humans and monkeys, then common sense implies that homaging God's entire family in pairwise fashion cannot be contingent upon a singular definition of culture or language (Kristeva). If mentation is a verb, and brain is a verb, then personal knowledge is a product of culture(s) as inherited context. This recent demonstration of common fronto-temporal effective connectivity in monkeys and humans suggests that common effective connectivity amongst executive rich-clubs amongst paleologically common neural networks is proof that gender and by extension racial inequality is linguistic genocide.

*Figure 1: Common organisational principle discovered in auditory to ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and (para)hippocampal effective connectivity in humans and monkeys. The figure shows stimulation-fMRI sites in both human and macaque brains, demonstrating the rapid, privileged auditory to VLPFC pathway and equally indirect auditory memory pathway (via parahippocampal gyrus).*

The natural fact is that common effective connectivity in humans and animals implies that default mode network connectomics is a [refs needed] common evolutionary solution for functional organization in the cerebral cortex, with species-specific genomic alchemy or algorithms hidden just out of sight from mutations that undoubtedly increase human susceptibility to aberrant networks observed in human psychiatric disorders (REFS).

In fact, the supposition that cognition takes time [Posner], implies that the brain as action is the posteriofrontal (Fuster) arrow to certainty conditioned on traveling waves of neural variability [Volume 109, Issue 5, 3 March 2021, Pages 751-766]. As such, the brain is equipped with an awesome array of sensory circuitry to bind (c.f. Gestalt) induced variability against default networks m.o. necessary for behavior.

The visual neocortex is a cubic parcellation of photic information captured instantaneously from a visual hemifield. Meaning the cortical columns in the mammalian neocortex is a mesh of computational nodes at the scale of parcellation, with nearest neighbors interpolation built into the brain matrix.

According to Mountcastle and Fuster, the cerebral cortex is an engine designed to transduce multiple macroscopic currents of action-perception cycles forward from tail to nose, through posterior sensory organs of seeing & hearing to the crown of the head, or where modern phrenology has bequeathed areas or regions controlling executive decision making.
