# Self-organizing Criticalities

Suppose every human being is a God. Then each God-being; as in when you "shine," see God in your interlocutor, or in a random passerby. Each of us individual Gods wear an ontogenetic crown.

The ontogenetic crown ðŸ‘‘ is the cortical mantle, or a manifold of neural networks on top of a base, or core [Tucker] primal and shared animalistic brain. This core brain is causally invariant, and thus shared across the animal kingdom. It is charged with near autonomous management of all bodily functions.

You see, in the span of a waking day, the cortex consumes spacetime as forms of waves of energy (light to see, sound to hear, touch to feel, olfaction to smell, and gustation to taste along the Ã¼ber primal gut-brain axis). As a two-dimensional manifold, also called surfaces, the crown ðŸ‘‘ of neural networks sits on top our core brain (by extension the hypothalamic gonadal pathways). Each individual crown is ontogenetically invariant, or structurally bivalent. The primary function of the cortex is to bend spacetime into a contiguous sphere of reality. On the grid of reality, you and I are a swiveling, blippy, quadrupole of cardiac and brain EMFs.

In a complex system structured as a Graph representation, the system _organizes into a load balancing state of criticality (SOC)_ where overloading or local failure shifts loads to other nodes. If the extra load is negligible, the system readily absorbs it, and the failure is averted. However, critical overloading amongst neighboring nodes will increase the likelihood that the excess load is redistributed to extended neighbors. Unless averted, the resulting cascading event has a magnitude related to the position and capacity of the nodes that failed initially.

I posit that a state of criticality (SOC) model of time-invariant [g] conditioned on working memory conductance means fluid intelligence cannot be Cartesian as recently suggested [Posner], and is more aptly described by EM spherical harmonics induced by variability in energetic state changes, or displacement of multipoles in space.
