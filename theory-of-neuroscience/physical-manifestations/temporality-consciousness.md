# Temporality and Consciousness

Consciousness is chirality. Because the cortex is an ontogenetic crown.

Determinant distribution for any pair of sexually dimorphic networks in the mammalian cortex:
(P(β|α)P(α))/P(β) for β=XX and α=XY genotypes in ontogenetic order of development.

Homeostasis is the diagnostics of consciousness.

Consciousness is the de facto parcellation of spacetime. De facto as in Deoxyribonucleic acid de facto. Consciousness is perception and proprioception, represented in the dimensions of Cartesian and Fourier spaces. Therefore, human intelligence and, by extension, a consciousness of the Cartesian flavor is partly summational on parcellated spacetime, and in that sense, Homeostasis is the diagnostics of consciousness. Yes, I said partly because, after all, we are merely the sum of parts. 

Hubel and Wiesel demonstrated the preferred geometry of the summational units in the mammalian neocortex: the cortical column. According to widespread knowledge, a cortical column is a group of neurons forming a cylindrical structure through the cerebral cortex of the brain perpendicular to the cortical surface. Consciousness is the homeostatic maintenance of an inner galaxy of energetic biology holding the brain upright and locomoting. And like its logical mirror in deep neural networks, cortical intelligence is the hive of neocortical perceptrons. Thus, cortical columns do sums and fancy things like logistical regression. To classify and cogitate when and where the body is in spacetime.

Hope has a direction: forward, how thought travels from occipital to frontal. How things are toys before they're tools or weapons.

Cognition is consumption. Cognition is the effect of brain-wide energy consumption, and thus your autobiographical memory a.k.a consciousness is the effect of your dietary intakes. Such as those demarcated by digestive phases.

Death is some inescapable tonic musculoskeletal configuration even Houdini would be hard-pressed to escape from.

Death and the Compass (Borges): The compass is maintained to stand upright, pointing towards death. If attentional orientation (Posner) in motion is pharmacologically desensitized then light-speed travel may be possible.
