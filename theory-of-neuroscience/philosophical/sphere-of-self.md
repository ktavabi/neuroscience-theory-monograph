# Sphere of Self

*I am in the east and in the west, I am below and above, I am this whole world. ~*

What is God if not a sense of humor? God is only the spatiotemporal gravitational field patterns of the üß† brain. These patterns are the energetic signatures of layered spherical shelves (core-shell model: reptilian, paleo-, and neo-cortical. Refs). God, I contend, is in the sense patterns (MEEG, BOLD, PET) of neocortical linear algebra.

However, the problem with institutional education is that the God sphere is heterogeneously asymmetrical, i.e., in most cases, *nurture* programming has failed. We are not 8 billion strong, ambidextrous, multilingual individuals or empaths. Instead, we are still a fudal and idolatrous bunch with overwhelming net consumption, and we have global industrial complexes to back it ‚¨ÜÔ∏è up.

In the neocortex, pyramidal neurons are fortunately oriented orthogonally to the scalp (Hammelinen personal comms) throughout the mammalian models of columnar cytoarchitectonics. In this landscape of self-emergent, organized criticalities give rise to geologically scaled down structural repose that allow for habits to evolve as WJ envisioned in his seminal Principles of Psychology.

In the columnar organization of computational units, bioenergetic pumping of information at synaptic clefts gives rise to not only spooky teleportation of information but also turns it into color vision (front loaded to categorization at the üëÅÔ∏è retina), music, and actual LLMs üòÇ. Talk about a sense of humor.

In the neocortex, columnar cytoarchitectonics provides God with fast and slow thinking üßê vis-a-vie autonomic (para- vs. sym-pathetic) adversarial control functions over a conscious agent that is temporarily behind physiologic time (Chronometry of cognition)[Posner].
