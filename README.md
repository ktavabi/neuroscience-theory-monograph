# ðŸ§  Neuroscience Theory Monograph

ðŸ”¬ A comprehensive mathematical framework exploring the foundations of intelligence across biological and artificial systems ðŸ“Š

ðŸ§® Examining neural networks, consciousness, and emergent intelligence through mathematical models, graph theory, and thermodynamic principles ðŸ’¡

ðŸ“š Structured as a Zettelkasten-style GitBook with interconnected notes on neurobiological substrates, statistical learning, physical manifestations, and AGI development ðŸ¤–

## Overview

This monograph presents a mathematical framework for understanding intelligence as emerging from complex neural systems. The work spans from biological implementations in mammalian brains to artificial implementations in computational systems, with particular attention to the underlying mathematical principles.

## Structure

The monograph is organized according to the following structure:

- **Cross-species Intelligence**: Examination of intelligence across different species
- **Mathematical Models**: Formalization of intelligence through statistical and graph-theoretical approaches
- **Neurobiological Substrates**: Columnar organization and core-shell models of neural architecture
- **Statistical Learning**: Naive Bayes and neural networks in biological and artificial systems
- **Physical Manifestations**: Bioenergetic information processing and self-organizing criticalities
- **Artificial General Intelligence**: Development pathways and implications
- **Philosophical Concepts**: Consciousness, ethics, and the mind-body problem
